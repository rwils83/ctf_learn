Steps: For this one I just used an online hex editor. There the flag was. Very simple. 
 

AAR: This challenge was marked hard. I feel this challenge was pretty simple. I could see where maybe if the person doing
the challenge did not know this was hex it would be hard, but most people would know that it was.

 

Disclaimer: I will not in any of my writeups include the flag. I see too often that solutions to these CTF challenges include the flag. I feel if someone 
is taking the time to try to learn how to do these, just showing them the steps is a more valuable lesson than actually giving them the answer. 
For the individuals looking for the flag, I am sorry if my writeups are not what you are looking for, but by knowing the steps it takes to get to the flag 
you will save time in the long run and walk away knowing how to do it in the future.

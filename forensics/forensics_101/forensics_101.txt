Writeup:

After downloading the file, I knew this would be a steganography challenge. I have some basic first steps I do for any of these challenges.

Steps:

1. I choose to always run strings [filename] on any stego challenges. Just part of my process. Sometimes you get lucky on the easier challenges. This
   was definitely one of those times. Once you run strings on this file, you will find the flag. 

AAR:

This challenge was labled as easy on the site. I agree this was a very basic challenge, as long as you knew that strings exist. 

Disclaimer: I will not in any of my writeups include the flag. I see too often that solutions to these CTF challenges include the flag. I feel if someone 
is taking the time to try to learn how to do these, just showing them the steps is a more valuable lesson than actually giving them the answer. 
For the individuals looking for the flag, I am sorry if my writeups are not what you are looking for, but by knowing the steps it takes to get to the flag 
you will save time in the long run and walk away knowing how to do it in the future.

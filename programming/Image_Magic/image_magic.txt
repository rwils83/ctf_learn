Challenge: 
It looks like someone messed up my picture! Can anyone reorganize the pixels? The python module PIL (Python Imaging Library) might be useful!

Update: I think whoever messed up my image took every column of pixels and put them side by side. Update: I think the width of the image was 304 
before they messed with it.

Writeup:

This one was a fun one. I enjoy programming challenges especially. Following are the steps that I took to solve

Steps:

1. The challenge creater was nice enough to tell us what we needed. We had to create a python script, and they even told us what module to import

2. Writing this script was a challenge for me. I spent quite a bit of time researching documentation on PIL to see what I had to do.

3. After finally getting the script right, I ran the script and the image showed the flag. I included the script with comments on how it makes sense to me


 

AAR:

This was set as hard, and I completely agree with the difficutly designation. It took a bit of time and research to figure it out. I normally would not include the 
script I used, I made this time the exception. 

Disclaimer: I will not in any of my writeups include the flag. I see too often that solutions to these CTF challenges include the flag. I feel if someone 
is taking the time to try to learn how to do these, just showing them the steps is a more valuable lesson than actually giving them the answer. 
For the individuals looking for the flag, I am sorry if my writeups are not what you are looking for, but by knowing the steps it takes to get to the flag 
you will save time in the long run and walk away knowing how to do it in the future.

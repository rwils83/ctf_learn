Writeup: 	



Steps: I chose to write a python script, which is included in this writeup folder. There are multiple ways
to do this challenge, my script does work but there are plenty of other ways to do this as well. I recommend 
trying different ways in different languages to see what way works best for you.

 

AAR: This challenge was marked as easy, which I agree with. The script took a little time to figure out but that 
is because I was trying to figure out which way I wanted to do this. The way I came up with was just one that would work.

 

Disclaimer: I will not in any of my writeups include the flag. I see too often that solutions to these CTF challenges include the flag. I feel if someone 
is taking the time to try to learn how to do these, just showing them the steps is a more valuable lesson than actually giving them the answer. 
For the individuals looking for the flag, I am sorry if my writeups are not what you are looking for, but by knowing the steps it takes to get to the flag 
you will save time in the long run and walk away knowing how to do it in the future.

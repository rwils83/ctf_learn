Disclaimer: I will not in any of my writeups include the flag. I see too often that solutions to these CTF challenges include the flag. I feel if someone 
is taking the time to try to learn how to do these, just showing them the steps is a more valuable lesson than actually giving them the answer. 
For the individuals looking for the flag, I am sorry if my writeups are not what you are looking for, but by knowing the steps it takes to get to the flag 
you will save time in the long run and walk away knowing how to do it in the future.
